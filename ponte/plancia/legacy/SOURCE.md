# Vendored original dashboard

Source repository: <https://github.com/danigio15/dashboardmodern>

These files are produced by `scripts/vendor_legacy.py` followed by
`scripts/split_legacy.py`, not copied by hand and not copied by a workflow. The
vendor script applies a small set of anchored patches —
the bridge prelude, the wizard connection step, the bake-download control, and
four confirmed upstream bug fixes — and each one must match exactly once or the
run fails rather than shipping an unverified vendor.

`VENDOR.json` records the upstream commit, the sha256 of each unpatched source
file, and which fixes are still carried locally. That list is how you tell
whether a fix has landed upstream yet.

To update:

```bash
python scripts/vendor_legacy.py --ref <tag-or-commit>
python scripts/split_legacy.py
npm run test:frontend
python -m pytest
```

For the reproducibility check, use the exact `commit` recorded in `VENDOR.json`
as `<tag-or-commit>`, run both scripts, and verify that `git status --short` is
empty. The first script deliberately creates patched monolithic HTML; the
second extracts its inline styles and scripts into the committed locale runtime,
debug, theme, and watchdog assets and leaves the small HTML shells behind.
The vendor step verifies the unpatched upstream sha256 values before applying
any patch. Use `--update-upstream` only when intentionally reviewing a new
upstream snapshot. Deterministic unified diffs under `patches/` make the shell,
runtime, and CSS production deltas part of the same clean-tree/review contract.

Do not copy files into this directory by any other route. A copy that skips the
pipeline produces a dashboard with no bridge — it will ask for a long-lived token
— and silently reintroduces the camera configuration data loss.

`config.js` is optional and loaded with an `onerror` fallback; the dashboard
runs without it.
